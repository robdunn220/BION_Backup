Good Evening Bill,

Recently, we started a company called The Bioinformatics Company, an  
efficient and adaptive company that can cater to the needs of  
professors/researchers that require next-generation sequencing data  
processing services. After obtaining bioinformatics training  
throughout my Ph.D. and post-doctoral fellowship, I realized my future  
interests were focused on developing bioinformatics pipelines for  
processing sequencing data produced from next-generation sequencing  
platforms. This experience also made me realize the need for  
streamlining this data processing step in genetics research to  
increase the rate at which this data can be available for  
analysis.&nbsp;

We understand that research projects can be stalled for months and  
even years due to unavailable bioinformatics expertise and personnel  
to carry out these pipelines after they have been developed and  
samples have been sequenced. In addition to these delays, it is  
critical that thoroughly trained personnel carry out such processing  
because poorly developed analyses can result in false conclusions that  
may affect not only publications but the subsequent allocation of  
money and efforts. The Bioinformatics Network provides customizable  
bioinformatics pipelines that meet the specific criteria required for  
each unique lab to succeed. We have developed multiple pipelines that  
can be used to process raw fasta/fastq files into annotated and ready  
to analyze variant calling format (VCF) files. We can analyze single  
or multiple genomes, exomes, and/or targeted regions for a multitude  
of species. Although my previous bioinformatics experience has mainly  
focused on human studies, we plan to branch out and process DNA from  
prokaryotes, protists, fungi, plants, and animals. We can alter,  
remove, or add bioinformatics processing steps to
ease the analysis and speed up the research timeline from conception  
to analyzed data.

As we previously discussed, you may know individuals that can benefit  
from our services. Please let us know if you can think of anyone who  
may be interested in such services, or feel free to forward the  
attached PDF outlining our services along to others. If they are  
interested, please have them contact Madison Bishop  
(Madison@thebioinformaticsnetwork.com)&nbsp; or William Bishop  
(William@thebioinformaticsnetwork.com). We would be happy to set up a  
meeting to discuss how we can best assist with their research needs.

Thanks,
William and Madison Bishop
