Good Evening Bill,<br>
Recently, we started a company called The Bioinformatics Network, an effici=
ent and adaptive company that can cater to the needs of professors/research=
ers that require next-generation sequencing data processing services. After=
 obtaining bioinformatics training throughout my Ph.D. and post-doctoral fe=
llowship, I realized my future interests were focused on developing bioinfo=
rmatics pipelines for processing sequencing data produced from next-generat=
ion sequencing platforms. This experience also made me realize the need for=
 streamlining this data processing step in genetics research to increase th=
e rate at which this data can be available for analysis.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We understand that research projects can be stalled for months and even yea=
rs due to unavailable bioinformatics expertise and personnel to carry out t=
hese pipelines after they have been developed and samples have been sequenc=
ed. In addition to these delays, it is critical that thoroughly trained per=
sonnel carry out such processing because poorly developed analyses can resu=
lt in false conclusions that may affect not only publications but the subse=
quent allocation of money and efforts. The Bioinformatics Network provides =
customizable bioinformatics pipelines that meet the specific criteria requi=
red for each unique lab to succeed. We have developed multiple pipelines th=
at can be used to process raw fasta/fastq files into annotated and ready to=
 analyze variant calling format (VCF) files. We can analyze single or multi=
