Dear=20Bioinformatics Network team,


I=E2=80=99m working with my wife, an aquatic ecologist, to sequence the gen=
ome=20=20
of=20a disease-causing cyanobacterium that she discovered. What makes=20=20
this=20an interesting challenge for sequencing is that Aetokthonos=20=20
hydrillacola=20is a filamentous cyanobacterium that has heterotrophic=20=20
bacteria=20associated with a mucilaginous sheath that surrounds the=20=20
filaments.


We=20can wash away most of the associated bacteria before DNA isolation,=20=
=20
but=20the resulting DNA is still a mixture of genomes from Aetokthonos=20=
=20
and=20other bacteria. In other labs working with similar cyanobacterium=20=
=20
issues,=20PacBio sequencing was used to generate long reads that could=20=
=20
be=20assembled into a complete genome.


We have now PacBio sequencing data and need bioinformatics to be done=20=20
to=20assemble the Aetokthonos genome. Is this something that you guys=20=20
could=20do?


Best regards,

Dayton
